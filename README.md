# Adventures in Financial Engineering

This repo is meant to document my adventures through various financial engineering study materials. I'm currently reading:

1) [A Primer for the Mathematics of Financial Engineering](http://www.fepress.org/primer-second-ed/)
2) [A Linear Algebra Primer for Financial Engineering](http://www.fepress.org/nla-primer/)

I have decided to complete the programming exercises in Julia. The language is currently at version 0.7-beta, which should be very close to the upcoming stable 1.0 release. You can read more about the language [here](https://julialang.org/) and track the release progress [here](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/milestones).

Thanks for browsing!
